# Challenge

Given [this](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices) dataset of housing prices in California, build a machine learning model to predict the price of a house given the features present in the dataset.

**You must:**
- Decide which ML algorithm is the most appropriate for this problem
- Partition your dataset into training and testing sets (and determine a good train/test ratio)
- Choose an appropriate metric to evaluate your model against the testing set

I'd recommend reviewing the code from lesson 3 to use as a template!
